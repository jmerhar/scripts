# Shell Scripts Collection

Welcome to my personal collection of shell scripts! This repository is a curated set of useful scripts designed to automate various tasks on Unix-like operating systems (macOS, Linux).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

-   `/system`: Contains low-level scripts for system administration and dependency management. These are often called by other scripts.
-   `/utility`: Contains high-level, user-facing scripts that perform specific, practical tasks.

Each directory has its own `README.md` with more detailed information about the scripts it contains.

## Usage

To use a script, you can either clone this repository and run it from the local directory or copy the script to a directory in your system's `PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`) to make it globally accessible.

Ensure that the scripts are executable:
```bash
chmod +x path/to/script.sh
```

## Contributing

This is a personal collection, but suggestions and improvements are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have an idea for a new script or a way to improve an existing one.
